# Undo RM

Undo RM is a powerful command-line extension designed to protect you from accidental file deletions. By replacing the traditional rm command, it moves deleted files to a designated trash folder, allowing for easy recovery when mistakes happen.

With Undo RM, you can simply use the trash command to safely delete files or directories, ensuring they are stored in a hidden trash directory instead of being permanently lost. When you need to recover a deleted item, the recover command allows you to restore files with just a few prompts, even handling conflicts if the original file exists.

Whether you’ve mistakenly deleted a document or want to retrieve multiple versions of the same file, Undo RM provides a user-friendly interface to select and restore your data. Say goodbye to the fear of permanent deletions—Undo RM empowers you to manage your files with confidence and ease!
