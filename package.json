  "description": "Undo RM is a powerful command-line extension designed to protect you from accidental file deletions. By replacing the traditional rm command, it moves deleted files to a designated trash folder, allowing for easy recovery when mistakes happen.\n\nWith Undo RM, you can simply use the trash command to safely delete files or directories, ensuring they are stored in a hidden trash directory instead of being permanently lost. When you need to recover a deleted item, the recover command allows you to restore files with just a few prompts, even handling conflicts if the original file exists.\n\nWhether you’ve mistakenly deleted a document or want to retrieve multiple versions of the same file, Undo RM provides a user-friendly interface to select and restore your data. Say goodbye to the fear of permanent deletions—Undo RM empowers you to manage your files with confidence and ease!",
